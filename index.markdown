# Sample Parsons Problems

Used as a temporary place for Parsons Problems to live while developing content for Self-Paced Computer Science Guides.


If want each problem to be it's own page, you can use relative path links at the bottom of each of your markdown pages as seen below. If you want students to be able to return to previous problems in this format, consider adding previous links or link to a table of contents like page.
